    "In this assignment, you are tasked with implementing various functions for a Mancala game. The game is played on a board with specific rules, and you will need to implement the core game logic by completing the `play`, `valid_move`, and `winning_eval` functions. You are provided with the `init` and `display_board` functions. The assignment is divided into two parts:"

    "* The large pits at the end of the board are called Mancalas\n",
    "* Set up the board with 4 stones per small pit (none in the mancalas)\n",

    "\n",
    "For the first part of the assignment, students will work on a small Mancala board. The board consists of 3 pits, each initially containing 2 stones. The students need to implement the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **play**: Implement the `play` function to allow players to take turns and make moves. The function should correctly distribute stones according to the specified game rules. The game should also switch between players after each play. **(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **valid_move**: Implement the `valid_move` function to ensure that a player's chosen move is valid. It should check if the selected pit is not empty and falls within the allowed pit range. **(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **winning_eval**: Implement the `winning_eval` function to determine when the game is over and which player wins. The game ends when any player's pits are all empty. The winner is the player with the most stones in their mancala. If both mancalas have the same number of stones, it's a tie. **(20 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Students should test their code by playing a sequence of moves shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "P1 picks pit 1, P2 picks pit 2, P1 picks pit 3...and so on.  The pits are 1-indexed when displaying and picking to make a move.  Make sure that your code gives an invalid move error when the pit chosen is empty or the pit choice is out of range.\n",
